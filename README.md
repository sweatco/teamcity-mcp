## Overview

The TeamCity MCP Server allows developers using AI-powered coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) to interact with TeamCity directly from their development environment via MCP tools.

> **Upgrading from 1.x?** Version 2.0.0 moved 15 tools from Dev to Full mode, including queue management, agent compatibility checks, and server health monitoring. If you relied on these tools in Dev mode, switch to `MCP_MODE=full` or use runtime mode switching (v2.1.0+). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Features

### 🚀 Two Operational Modes

- **Dev Mode** (default): Safe CI/CD operations (31 tools, ~14k context tokens)
  - Trigger builds and monitor status
  - Fetch build logs and inspect test failures
  - List projects, configurations, and queue
  - Read parameters and investigate problems

- **Full Mode**: Complete infrastructure management (87 tools, ~26k context tokens)
  - All Dev mode features, plus:
  - Create and clone build configurations
  - Manage build steps, triggers, and dependencies
  - Configure VCS roots and agents
  - Full CRUD for parameters (build config, project, and output parameters)
  - Queue management and server administration

**Runtime Mode Switching (v2.1.0+):** Switch between modes at runtime using the `get_mcp_mode` and `set_mcp_mode` tools—no restart required. MCP clients that support notifications will see the tool list update automatically.

See the [Tools Mode Matrix](docs/mcp-tools-mode-matrix.md) for the complete list of 87 tools and their availability by mode.

### 🎯 Key Capabilities

- Trigger and monitor builds, fetch logs, and inspect test failures
- Token-based authentication to TeamCity; sensitive values redacted in logs
- Modern architecture: simple, direct implementation with a singleton client
- Performance-conscious: fast startup with minimal overhead
- Clean codebase with clear module boundaries

## Choosing between teamcity-mcp and the built-in MCP

TeamCity 2026.1 ships with a built-in MCP endpoint at `<server-url>/app/mcp` exposing three tools: build log retrieval, a generic REST GET, and a build trigger (forced to `personal=true`). It is server-resident, requires no install, and is a sensible default for read-and-rerun workflows.

teamcity-mcp is a different shape: an 87-tool typed surface focused on AI-driven workflows that need writes, multi-server support, or pre-2026.1 compatibility.

| Use case                                                              | Recommendation                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Read build logs, trigger builds, simple read flows                    | Built-in (TeamCity 2026.1+) — zero install                                                 |
| Manage parameters, agents, queue, mutes, build configs, VCS roots     | teamcity-mcp                                                                               |
| TeamCity server older than 2026.1                                     | teamcity-mcp                                                                               |
| Multi-server / multi-tenant deployment                                | teamcity-mcp (HTTP transport — [PR #491](https://github.com/Daghis/teamcity-mcp/pull/491)) |
| Typed tool surface for better agent reliability on chained operations | teamcity-mcp                                                                               |

Both can coexist. The built-in is a good first stop; teamcity-mcp is the power tool for everything the built-in doesn't reach.

For the design reasoning, see [docs/strategy.md](docs/strategy.md) and [docs/non-goals.md](docs/non-goals.md).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.10.0 (LTS versions 20, 22, 24 tested in CI)
- TeamCity Server 2020.1+ with REST API access
- TeamCity authentication token

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Daghis/teamcity-mcp.git
cd teamcity-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your TeamCity URL and token

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

### npm Package

Run the MCP server via npx (requires Node 20.x). Set your TeamCity environment variables inline or via a `.env` in the working directory.

```bash
# One-off run (inline envs)
TEAMCITY_URL="https://teamcity.example.com" \
TEAMCITY_TOKEN="<your_token>" \
MCP_MODE=dev \
npx -y @daghis/teamcity-mcp

# Or rely on .env in the current directory
npx -y @daghis/teamcity-mcp
```

## Claude Code

- Add the MCP (relying on `.env` for configuration):
  - `claude mcp add teamcity -- npx -y @daghis/teamcity-mcp`
- With env vars (if not using .env):
  - `claude mcp add teamcity -e TEAMCITY_URL="https://teamcity.example.com" -e TEAMCITY_TOKEN="tc_<your_token>" -- npx -y @daghis/teamcity-mcp`
- With CLI arguments (recommended for Windows):
  - `claude mcp add teamcity -- npx -y @daghis/teamcity-mcp --url "https://teamcity.example.com" --token "tc_<your_token>" --mode dev`
- Add `-s user` to install user-wide instead of project-scoped (default)
- Context usage (Opus 4.1, estimates):
  - Dev (default): ~14k tokens for MCP tools
  - Full (`MCP_MODE=full`): ~26k tokens for MCP tools

### Windows Users

On Windows, Claude Code's MCP configuration [may not properly merge environment variables](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1254). Use CLI arguments as a workaround:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "teamcity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@daghis/teamcity-mcp",
        "--url",
        "https://teamcity.example.com",
        "--token",
        "YOUR_TOKEN"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Or use a config file for better security (token not visible in process list):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "teamcity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@daghis/teamcity-mcp", "--config", "C:\\path\\to\\teamcity.env"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Environment is validated centrally with Zod. Supported variables and defaults:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=info

# TeamCity Configuration (aliases supported)
TEAMCITY_URL=https://teamcity.example.com
TEAMCITY_TOKEN=your-auth-token
# Optional aliases:
# TEAMCITY_SERVER_URL=...
# TEAMCITY_API_TOKEN=...

# MCP Mode (dev or full)
MCP_MODE=dev

# Optional advanced TeamCity options (defaults shown)
# Connection
# TEAMCITY_TIMEOUT=30000
# TEAMCITY_MAX_CONCURRENT=10
# TEAMCITY_KEEP_ALIVE=true
# TEAMCITY_COMPRESSION=true

# Extra headers attached to every TeamCity request — useful when TeamCity
# sits behind a reverse proxy that gates access on custom headers (e.g.
# Cloudflare Zero Trust service tokens). One env var per header; in the
# suffix, `_` maps to `-` and `__` escapes a literal `_`. Suffixes that
# already contain `-` (set via tools that bypass the shell) pass through.
# TEAMCITY_HEADER_CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID=<id>          # → CF-ACCESS-CLIENT-ID
# TEAMCITY_HEADER_CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>  # → CF-ACCESS-CLIENT-SECRET
# TEAMCITY_HEADER_X_API__KEY=<value>                # → X-API_KEY

# Retry
# TEAMCITY_RETRY_ENABLED=true
# TEAMCITY_MAX_RETRIES=3
# TEAMCITY_RETRY_DELAY=1000
# TEAMCITY_MAX_RETRY_DELAY=30000

# Pagination
# TEAMCITY_PAGE_SIZE=100
# TEAMCITY_MAX_PAGE_SIZE=1000
# TEAMCITY_AUTO_FETCH_ALL=false

# Circuit Breaker
# TEAMCITY_CIRCUIT_BREAKER=true
# TEAMCITY_CB_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5
# TEAMCITY_CB_RESET_TIMEOUT=60000
# TEAMCITY_CB_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD=2
```

These values are normalized in `src/config/index.ts` and consumed by `src/teamcity/config.ts` via helper getters.

## Usage Examples

Once integrated with your AI coding assistant:

```
"Build the frontend on feature branch"
"Why did last night's tests fail?"
"Deploy staging with the latest build"
"Create a new build config for the mobile app"
```

### Tool Responses and Pagination

- Responses: Tools now return consistent MCP content. For list/get operations, the `content[0].text` contains a JSON string. Example shape:
  `{ "items": [...], "pagination": { "page": 1, "pageSize": 100 } }` or `{ "items": [...], "pagination": { "mode": "all", "pageSize": 100, "fetched": 250 } }`.
- Pagination: Most list\_\* tools accept `pageSize`, `maxPages`, and `all`:
  - `pageSize` controls items per page.
  - `all: true` fetches multiple pages up to `maxPages`.
  - Legacy `count` on `list_builds` is kept for compatibility but `pageSize` is preferred.

### Validation and Errors

- Input validation: Tool inputs are validated with Zod schemas; invalid input returns a structured error payload in the response content (JSON string) with `success: false` and `error.code = VALIDATION_ERROR`.
- Error shaping: Errors are formatted consistently via a global handler. In production, messages may be sanitized; sensitive values (e.g., tokens) are redacted in logs.

### API Usage

```typescript
import { TeamCityAPI } from '@/api-client';

// Get the API client instance
const api = TeamCityAPI.getInstance();

// List projects
const projects = await api.listProjects();

// Get build status
const build = await api.getBuild('BuildId123');

// Trigger a new build
const newBuild = await api.triggerBuild('BuildConfigId', {
  branchName: 'main',
});
```

> **Note:** The legacy helpers exported from `src/teamcity/index.ts` remain only for compatibility and include placeholder implementations. Prefer the MCP tools (see the reference linked above) or the `TeamCityAPI` shown here when automating workflows.

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Type check
npm run typecheck

# Build for production
npm run build

# Analyze bundle for Codecov
npm run build:bundle
```

### Bundle analysis in CI

The CI workflow runs `npm run build:bundle` and uploads the generated `coverage/bundles` JSON using `codecov/codecov-action` with the `javascript-bundle` plugin.

## API Documentation

The MCP server exposes tools for TeamCity operations. Each tool corresponds to specific TeamCity REST API endpoints:

### Build Management

- `TriggerBuild` - Queue a new build
- `GetBuildStatus` - Check build progress
- `FetchBuildLog` - Retrieve build logs
- `ListBuilds` - Search builds by criteria

### Test Analysis

- `ListTestFailures` - Get failing tests
- `GetTestDetails` - Detailed test information
- `AnalyzeBuildProblems` - Identify failure reasons

### Configuration (Full Mode Only)

- `create_build_config` - Create new TeamCity build configurations with full support for:
  - VCS roots (Git, SVN, Perforce) with authentication
  - Build steps (script, Maven, Gradle, npm, Docker, PowerShell)
  - Triggers (VCS, schedule, finish-build, maven-snapshot)
  - Parameters and template-based configurations
  - See the [MCP Tool Reference](docs/mcp-tools-reference.md) for argument details and additional options.
- `clone_build_config` - Duplicate existing configurations into any project, preserving steps, triggers, and parameters.
- `update_build_config` - Adjust names, descriptions, artifact rules, and pause state for a configuration.
- `manage_build_steps` - Add, update, remove, or reorder build steps through a single tool surface.
- `manage_build_triggers` - Add or delete build triggers with full property support.
- `create_vcs_root` & `add_vcs_root_to_build` - Define VCS roots and attach them to build configurations.

See also: [`docs/TEAMCITY_MCP_TOOLS_GUIDE.md`](docs/TEAMCITY_MCP_TOOLS_GUIDE.md) for expanded workflows and examples that align with the current MCP implementation.

## Security

### Token Management

- Configure `TEAMCITY_TOKEN` via environment variable or config file (see `.env.example`); never commit real tokens
- Use a token with minimal required permissions; read-only tokens work for most Dev mode operations
- Token-based authentication only; the MCP server does not support username/password
- Logs redact sensitive values including tokens

### Mode Selection

- Prefer **Dev mode** unless Full mode is explicitly needed—this limits the blast radius of any misconfiguration or prompt injection
- Full mode enables destructive operations (project deletion, agent management) that cannot be easily undone

### Network Security

- Always use HTTPS for TeamCity connections; the server does not enforce this but strongly recommends it
- The MCP server connects only to the configured TeamCity URL; no other network calls are made

### AI Assistant Considerations

- AI assistants could be manipulated via prompt injection in build logs, test output, or other TeamCity data
- Dev mode's limited tool set reduces the impact of such attacks
- All actions appear in TeamCity's audit log under the token's associated user
- Build logs and test failure details may contain sensitive information (secrets, paths, internal URLs) that become visible to the AI assistant

### Repository Security

This repository has GitHub secret scanning and push protection enabled. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.
